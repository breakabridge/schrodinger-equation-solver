# schrodinger-equation-solver
A 2D C++ solver of Schrödinger's equation for a wavefunction ψ in a scalar potential V. The code uses the FTCS method to calculate ψ at each timestep. There is Python code to animate |ψ|². The idea comes from the 2011 paper "Numerical Resolution of the Schrödinger Equation" by Jørgensen et al.
